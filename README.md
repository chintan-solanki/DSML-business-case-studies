# DSML-business-case-studies

A collection of various business case studies I worked on as part of the course work for a Data Science and Machine learning Program. Each case study consists of a business problem, the proposed solution (with focus on a subset of learned concepts), basic EDA, necessary Uni-variate/Bi-variate analysis, the core solution to the problem, business insights, and finally any recommendations based on the insights.
